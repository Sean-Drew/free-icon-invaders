**A web browser game. The objective of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by defeating enemies before they attack you. For each enemy defeated, your score increases!**

---

## General Features:

- Aim the 'tank' by pointing your mouse in the direction you want to face. The 'tank' will rotate appropiately to correspond with the direction of the mouse.

- Shoot your enemies by left-clicking on the mouse. When a bullet hits an enemy, they're destroyed!

- The player's user interface displays the score and health bar. The score will increase for each enemy destroyed and the health bar will decrease when the player's 'tank' is struck by an enemy. When your health bar is depleted, the game is over.

- NPC enemies will spawn in random spots and move around the game field. Their token, color, size, speed and point value are generated at random.

- After the game ends your score is displayed and you have the option to play again!
